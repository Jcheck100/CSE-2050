# Mod 10 Lab: Priority Queues

Implement the Priority Queue ADT with two (non-heap) data structures:

* `PQ_UL` - priority queue ADT with unordered list data structure
* `PQ_OL` - priority queue ADT with ordered (sorted) list data structure

## Part 1 - `class Entry`

Your Priority Queues can both use the same Entry class.

### Magic Methods

* `init` - gives entries an `item` and a `priority`.

* `lt(self, other)` - return `True` if `self` has a lower priority than `other`, `False` otherwise.

* `eq(self, other)` - returns `True` if the two entries have the same priority *and* item. 

## Part 2 - Priority Queue classes `PQ_UL` and `PQ_OL`

Both priority queues should support the following ADT:

### Magic Methods

* `len`
   * returns the number of entries in the priority queue

### Non-magic Methods 

* `insert(item, priority)`
   * adds `item` with given `priority` to priority queue

* `find_min()`
   * returns (but does not remove) the object with minimum `priority`. 
   * return the `Entry` object, not just the item.

* `remove_min()`
   * removes and returns the object with minimum `priority`. This means an item with priority `0` will be returned before an item with priority `5`, for instance.
   * return the `Entry` object, not just the item.

### Special Cases/Notes

* Feel free to use the `list.sort()` method in this assignment. It's `O(nlogn)`.

## Submitting

At a minimum, submit the following files:

* `lab10.py`
   * contains classes
      * `PQ_UL` - unordered list
      * `PQ_OL` - ordered list    

Students must submit **individually** by the due date (typically Sunday at 11:59 pm EST) to receive credit.
